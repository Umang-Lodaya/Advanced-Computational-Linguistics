# Advanced-Computational-Linguistics

## Pre-requisite:  
1. Machine Learning - I and II 
2. Computational Linguistics 
 
## Objectives: 
To teach machine learning and deep Learning techniques to build Computational models for real world applications. 
 
## Outcomes: On completion of the course, the learner will be able to: 
1. Apply classification techniques on linguistic data. 
2. Apply machine Learning and deep learning techniques to build language model. 
3. Develop applications based on natural language processing.

## Experiments:
1. Implement a Spam classifier using Na√Øve Bayes classifier
2. Implement a Sentiment Analysis on linguistic data to study different feature extraction techniques like bag of words, TF_IDF, word to vector and compare their performance.
3. Implement Fake News Classifier using LSTM-Deep Learning Model
4. Implement Informa on Retrieval for extrac ng Text from Webpages and Image.
5. Implement Machine Translation to translate English to Hindi
6. Implementation of Transformer model using PyTorch
7. To study perform various Natural Language Processing task like Text summarization, Seniment Analysis using available libraries like Hugging Face's Transformers, TensorFlow or PyTorch
8. Fine tuning BERT model to perform Natural Language Processing task.
